## Using Python and Statsmodels for Principles of Econometrics 

This repository contains the Jupyter notebooks used in the book *Using Python and Statsmodels for Principles of Econometrics* by Ogunc, Scholten, and Wood (https://a.co/d/gU4Zz0G).  The book is a supplement to the widely-adopted textbook *Principles of Econometrics, 5th Edition* by Carter Hill (publisher).  

The data files used in this book are available online at https://principlesofeconometrics.com, where you can also find errata for the textbook and other ancillary information. 

These notebooks execute as discussed in the book at the time of publication (June 2025), but please note that Statsmodels is a package in development (as is Python itself), so it is possible that at a later time there may be problems with some of the code cells.
